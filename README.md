#### Vision

> Computer vision in Python 3 using Sklearn, Scipy, Skimage, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Imageio and other modules to segment, extract properties and classify images using neural networks and classification algorithms

##### Setup

This project was built using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation) version management to Python. To run this project you need to clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/Sphinxs/Vision.git` and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) via pyenv.

Install Anaconda 3-5 via pyenv:

```zsh
pyenv install anaconda3-5.2.0
```

Set the Anaconda to local project:

```zsh
pyenv local anaconda3-5.2.0
```

##### Run

To run the examples select the script and execute using python interpreter:

```zsh
python l00_e00.py
```
