Using KNN, SVM and Naive Bayes algorithms to classify the Iris objects, the best results are SVN and KNN. In this context, the amount of data is small, so KNN has a good training speed, once it don't really have the training step, and the SVM algorithm deal well with discrepant data, once the dataset Iris it's not so heterogeneous SVM goes well in dealing with the data. Naive Bayes is a probabilistic algorithm, so, same if the data it's homogeneous, it is have 97 % of assertiveness.
